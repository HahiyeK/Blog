Design and develop a beautiful, interactive, and responsive Single Page Application (SPA) personal blog using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no external frameworks or libraries). The blog should serve as a dynamic showcase of my journey—highlighting what I’ve done, what I’m currently working on, and my personal brand. 

Core Features:
Two Main Views (SPA Navigation):
Public Profile & Content View:
A visually engaging landing page that displays:
My profile picture (with a clean, modern card layout)
A short bio or introduction
A responsive grid or timeline of my posts/content (photos, documents, updates)
Each content item should display a preview (e.g., image thumbnail or document icon), title, date, and short description
Admin Dashboard (Login Required):
Accessible only after logging in with a simple username/password (hardcoded for now). This view allows me to:
Upload new content (images or documents like PDFs)
Write/edit post titles and descriptions
Change my profile picture by uploading a new image
Log out and return to the public view
Beautiful & Cohesive Design:
Use a soft, modern color palette (e.g., muted pastels, gradients, or a curated theme like indigo-teal with warm accents)
Smooth transitions and subtle animations (e.g., fade-ins, hover effects)
Fully responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)
Clean typography with good readability
Card-based or masonry-style content layout for visual appeal
Interactive Elements:
Clicking a content item opens a modal with a larger view (image lightbox or document preview/download)
Real-time preview of profile picture and content during upload
Elegant loading states and user feedback (e.g., “Upload successful!”)
Navigation between views without page reloads (true SPA behavior using DOM manipulation and browser history API)
Technical Requirements:
All data (profile info, posts, images) stored in localStorage for persistence (no backend required)
Image uploads converted to base64 for storage in localStorage
Simple login form with validation (e.g., username: “admin”, password: “blog123” – stored securely in code for demo purposes)
Modular, well-commented JavaScript with clear separation of concerns (e.g., UI rendering, data handling, routing)
Bonus (if feasible):
Dark/light mode toggle
“Currently Working On” badge or status indicator on the profile
Filter or sort content by type (photo vs. document) or date
The final result should feel like a premium portfolio-blog hybrid—minimal yet expressive, functional yet delightful—where visitors are drawn into my story, and I can easily update my journey anytime.
